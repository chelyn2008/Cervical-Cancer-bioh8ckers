# Cervical Cancer Prediction Model

## Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model for binary classification of cervical cancer based on patient data.

## Data
The data given includes several clinical & demographic features of numerous patients, which are relevant to cervical cancer prediction.

## Features
- Data cleaning + EDA
- Implementation of binary classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
